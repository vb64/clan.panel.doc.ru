Stronghold
==========

If your clan has the "Attack and defense of Stronghold" mode enabled, you will be able to see a summary of all battles planned in the SH on the "Stronghold" tab. 
These data are read by the clan-panel from the Wargaming clan portal. The max "age" of the data is 10 minutes. 
If the data were last read more than 10 minutes ago, they will be automatically recalculated using the Wargaming portal.

Officers in your clan will have access to the "Defense of Stronghold" button on this page. Clicking it will open the defense schedule for your Stronghold.
