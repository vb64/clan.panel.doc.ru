If you spend a lot of time searching for the objects of attack in SH, you can use the function "Search for SH attacks".
This function is available for officers of clans, with paid plan (base or premium) in effect.

At the "Search for SH attacks" page

* Choose from the list enemy's hour of the  defense and the level of SH
* Enter in the field "Max position in rating" value of position WG ranking. Clans above this position in the ranking will not be included in the search results
* Click the button labelled "Find"

List of clans that have a SH, corresponding to your search criteria and the available for the attacks in the next 2 weeks, will be displayed as a table.
The table has the following columns:

* Clan tag. Click to go to a page with a list of dates, when this clan can be attacked
* Position in the ranking of WG
* The number of buildings in the clan's SH
* The average level of SH buildings
* The number of days in the next 2 weeks, when clan is available for attacks

The results do not include next clans:

* You have a scheduled battle in the future

* Your allies by SH defense (if you are a member of SH alliance)
* Serving with premium plan

Below is a link to the table of clans, the relevant search criteria, which after the specified time it will be possible to put a new attack on 2 weeks ahead.
At the time of this new attack clans have no neutrality, this new attack does not fall on their day off, and you do not have scheduled battles with them.

.. note::
   How does this work

   Once a day the first few thousands clans rated WG scanned and stored in the database.
   Clans that have a battles in their schedule, additionally scanned several times a day to update data in a clan-panel.
